        This file contains the 3D models in STEP (.stp) format for Versal devices.
	Files are included for each product and package combination.

How to interpret individual filenames within the zipped file
---------------------------------------------------------------
	
The file names identify the specific product or products for which the model applies - device or devices & package.
The files are named with 2 or more recognizable attributes separated by a dash "-" or underscore "_". 
	
The attributes are 
 1. Device name or names (e.g. vc1902_vc1802_vm1802) 
 2. Package name (e.g. vsva2197)	

Example - For the model for XCVC1902-VSVA2197, the filename will be:
vc1902_vc1802_vm1802-vsva2197.stp
	
Use of files
-------------
Unzip the files into the appropriate library for the tool.
Import or merge these into your design/assembly and insert them at the appropriate locations as your specific tool flow allows.
